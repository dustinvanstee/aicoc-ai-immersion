The above pattern is based on the ULMFit algorithm from Jeremy Howard.  https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146.  You can build many NLP classifiers using this technique and apply to many domains.   If you wanted to deploy this model, you could build a flask app with the fast ai dependencies and try to get that up and running!"
