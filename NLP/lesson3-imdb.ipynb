       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

       "  xxmaj highly recommended series , i want more ! !,xxbos xxmaj my cable xxup tv has what 's called the xxmaj arts channel , which is a \" catch - as - catch - can \" situation sometimes , sometimes films , sometimes short clips of films or ballets , and i came into this just as the bar scene came on , where they tear up their coupons . xxmaj excellent , exquisite , xxmaj ealing wins again , my wartime - xxmaj glasgow - raised mother would love this , should i ever find a copy of it . xxmaj some of xxmaj britain 's best artists , from xxmaj mr xxmaj holloway to xxmaj wayne and xxmaj radford and the delicious xxmaj miss xxmaj rutherford , having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the xxmaj home xxmaj office . xxmaj loved the last scene , where as soon as they are \" back in xxmaj england ! \" the temperature plummets and it rains ...,xxbos \" xxmaj one shot , one kill , no exceptions . \" a must see if you are into marines or snipers . two big thumbs up ! xxmaj great overall storyline , great camera work , good drama , action , details , and more . xxmaj pretty close to the real thing . xxmaj but this is n't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults . this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins . xxmaj the plot has some depth but this movie is n't really about making you think . its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action . sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie . xxmaj tom xxmaj berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life . the plain of dealing with all of the death . xxmaj must see for sniper fans .,xxbos xxmaj this movie works because it feels so genuine . xxmaj the story is simple and realistic , perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that most / all of us experienced during our teen years . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers . xxmaj the dialogue is fresh and honest ... and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references . xxmaj also , the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful , bringing the xxmaj lower xxmaj east xxmaj side setting to life in a very tangible way . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj on an artistic level , i love this movie because it reminds me of great xxmaj italian neo - realism films like xxmaj the xxmaj bicycle xxmaj thief and xxmaj la xxmaj strada . xxmaj movies rarely feel as \" real \" as this does ... or as xxmaj bicycle xxmaj thief did . xxmaj and the only other movie i 've seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is xxmaj elia xxmaj kazan 's xxmaj splendor in the xxmaj grass . xxmaj writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett deserves tremendous praise . xxmaj this film is quite an achievement . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj on a personal level , i am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic xxmaj america with love and respect . xxmaj as an xxmaj italian - xxmaj american , i hate the way my own people come off in the cinema ( as racist , womanizing , criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics ) , and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations . xxmaj hispanics and xxmaj asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in xxmaj westerns and action movies . ( xxmaj good thing xxmaj gong xxmaj li did n't try to become famous in xxmaj america ! ) \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj of course , thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures , and the influence of xxmaj miramax , we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there ... but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is easily one of the best . xxmaj while i do really like xxmaj my xxmaj big xxmaj fat xxmaj greek xxmaj wedding , it is a refreshing change that xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is played straight ( with less exaggerated and broadly - drawn characters ) while still being very funny in its own right . xxmaj finally ! xxmaj latino characters worthy of note . i have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj of course , now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the xxmaj dominican xxmaj republic , i hope xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett gets around to making a movie about xxmaj italians soon ! :) - xxmaj marc xxunk,xxbos xxmaj fantastic documentary of 1924 . xxmaj this early 20th century geography of today 's xxmaj iraq was powerful . xxmaj watch this and tell me if xxmaj cecil xxup b. demille did n't take notes before making his xxmaj the xxmaj ten xxmaj commandments . xxmaj merian xxup c. xxmaj cooper , the photographer , later created xxmaj cinerama , an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film . xxmaj fans of xxmaj werner xxmaj herzog will find this film to be a treasure , with heartbreaking tales of struggle , complimented by the land around them , never has the human capacity to endure been so evident . xxmaj the fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects , but of the filmmakers themselves .\n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj it made me laugh my ass off . a must - have for the xxup cky / xxmaj jackass aficionado !,xxbos xxmaj despite the previous reviewer 's screed , this is a well paced and interesting documentary with lots of clips from classic 1950s sci - fi films that influenced xxmaj spielberg , xxmaj lucas and others in their more recent efforts . i agree that xxmaj spielberg 's films are n't even in the same league as the films discussed here , such as xxmaj william xxmaj cameron xxmaj menzies ' brilliant xxup invaders xxup from xxup mars , to name just one of the many titles examined , but this is still a remarkably good overview of 1950s paranoid sci - fi . xxmaj yes , it turns into a commercial for the tepid remake of xxup war xxup of xxup the xxup worlds during the last fifteen minutes ; you can turn that off . xxmaj the rest is surprisingly good , and it 's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them , even if they ca n't begin to match the originals .,xxbos xxmaj this is a beautiful , funny , vivid film . xxmaj it 's even better than \" xxmaj nuovo xxmaj cinema xxmaj paradiso \" -- which it parallels but does n't replicate . xxmaj the story completes a full circle and had the theater beaming as the credits rolled . a hundred years after this story takes place , we 're just as intrigued by flickering images in a dark theater .,xxbos xxmaj this is screamingly funny ( well , except when xxmaj bruce is in the hospital scene , which is a little sad ) . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the horror comes from viewing the whole story through the eyes of the xxmaj clint xxmaj eastwood character . xxmaj seeing him stranded in the house and held captive by the women is a very \" beguiling \" experience indeed . xxmaj and who is \" beguiled \" here exactly ? xxmaj are the women beguiled by xxmaj eastwood 's incredible looks ? xxmaj are we , the viewers , beguiled by both his sexual allure and the potential deviant sexualities it unleashes ? xxmaj or does \" beguiled \" refer to what the director does here-- holds us enthralled for a short space only to ( xxunk us go ? xxmaj don xxmaj siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films i had the pleasure of watching .\n",
