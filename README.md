## How can you run these notebooks ?

Most of the notebooks were built and tested on WML-CE version 1.7.  They should run on most platforms, but not garaunteed and tested.  Where applicable we provide a conda yaml file to reproduce an environment as close as possible to our tested versions.  Email vanstee@us.ibm.com for support or questions.  The repo is still a work in progress and we update it as new projects emerge.
