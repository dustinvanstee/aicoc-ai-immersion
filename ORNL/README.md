# Environment Setup
___
To setup an environment that can run the labs shown, you will need to use IBM's WML-CE (now called OPEN-CE) module with some additional packages.  To create your own conda virtual environment with all the dependencies, you can use the provided requirements.txt file in this repo with the following commands.

1.  Load WML-CE to get access to conda
module load ibm-wml-ce/1.7.0-1

2. Create a conda virtual environment cloned off most recent WML-CE with extra pkgs
conda env create -f wmlce17-ornl.yml
